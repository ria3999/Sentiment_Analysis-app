This is the sentiment analysis web app developed using Python and Flask is used in the front-end which can take user inputs using a web browser based interface and providing 
the result on the same page itself.In this project I have used a LSTM based deep learning model which can take text-based sentences as inputs and produce the corresponding 
sentiment and probability associated with that sentiment. This model is used as a back-end to this application. 
I have used IMDB dataset to train my deep learning model.

My web app looks like-
